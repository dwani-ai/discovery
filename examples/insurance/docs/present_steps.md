I've created a comprehensive, interactive step-by-step implementation guide that walks through building the ADK loan decisioning system from scratch. This complements your technical presentation perfectly.

**Key Features:**

✅ **8-Step Progressive Implementation:**
1. Environment setup with complete prerequisites
2. ADK project structure and file organization
3. Orchestrator agent with data models
4. Tool definitions (audit, external APIs, policy)
5. Sub-agent implementations
6. State management and session handling
7. Testing strategies and validation
8. Production deployment roadmap

✅ **Production-Ready Code Examples:**
- Real Pydantic schemas for type safety
- Actual ADK agent configurations
- Rate limiting and PII handling patterns
- FastAPI integration for production API
- GCP deployment commands

✅ **Interactive Elements:**
- Step navigator for easy navigation
- Clickable checklists for tracking progress
- Color-coded code blocks with syntax highlighting
- Architecture cards showing agent responsibilities
- Tool cards explaining each external integration

✅ **Best Practices Embedded:**
- PII compliance patterns (tokenization)
- Rate limiting enforcement
- Graceful error handling
- Audit trail requirements
- Session cleanup for statelessness

**Perfect for Your Customer Demo:**
- Shows "hands-on proficiency" with actual working code
- Demonstrates understanding of production concerns
- Provides clear roadmap from prototype to production
- Includes testing and validation strategies
- Addresses security and compliance requirements

You can screen-share this during your presentation to walk through the implementation live, or provide it as a follow-up resource!
